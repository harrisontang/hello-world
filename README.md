# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository. 

Hi there,

My name is Harrison. I live in Brisbane Australia. I am 28.

I am currently studying Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) through Open 
Universities Australia Online Learning, while working casually.

I am taking Introduction to Technology and Introduction to Programming.

This is my first GitHub repository. I'm currently using the github hello-world tutorial to create this branch.
